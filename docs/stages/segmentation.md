# Stage 2 — Segmentation

Runs image-based segmentation with Cellpose-SAM on DAPI/PolyT (MERSCOPE) or
DAPI/18S (Xenium), then refines those masks using the actual transcript
positions with ProSeg. The Cellpose output is the **prior** that ProSeg's
MCMC sampler starts from.

## What it does

1. Load the SpatialData zarr from stage 1 and pick the right image channels.
2. Tile the image, run Cellpose on each tile, merge masks back into a
   single global-pixel-coordinate mask array.
3. Filter masks by eccentricity / area (reject junk).
4. Convert the Cellpose mask from pixel coordinates to microns using the
   platform transform matrix.
5. Export transcripts to a ProSeg-friendly CSV, seeded with the cell id each
   transcript falls inside (from the Cellpose mask).
6. Resolve or bootstrap the external ProSeg binary, then run it against that
   CSV + mask.
7. Convert ProSeg's raw output zarr to "latest" SpatialData format.

## Nextflow subworkflow

[`SEGMENT`](../../workflows/modules/segmentation.nf) is a subworkflow with two
independently scheduled processes per dataset:

| Process | Tool | Default resources | Scheduler route |
|---------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `CELLPOSE_SEGMENT` | Cellpose-SAM | 12 CPUs, 212 GB RAM, `cellpose_segment_max_forks = 1` | GPU queue and one GPU when `cellpose_gpu=true`; local GPU lock on workstations |
| `PROSEG_SEGMENT` | ProSeg | 32 CPUs, 220 GB RAM, `proseg_segment_max_forks = 2` | CPU/HTC queue; no GPU request, lock, or Apptainer `--nv` |

This boundary prevents the long CPU-only ProSeg sampler from retaining a GPU
node after Cellpose has finished. The two processes still form the single
stage named `segment` for `--start_stage`, `--stop_stage`, and `--only_stage`.

- **Input:** `tuple(key, pair_id, platform, seg_config_json)`.
- **CLIs:** `merxen cellpose-segment --config segment_config.json`, followed by
  `merxen proseg-segment --config segment_config.json ...`. The original
  `merxen segment` command remains available for direct, single-process use.
- **Output:**
  - `segment_out/proseg_base_latest.zarr` — refined segmentation as SpatialData.
  - `segment_out/cellpose_masks_tiled.npy` — global-pixel mask (uint32).
  - `segment_out/transcripts_for_proseg.csv` — transcripts with seeded cell ids.
  - `segment_out/cellpose_transforms.json` — affine metadata handed from
    Cellpose to ProSeg.
- **publishDir:** `${outdir}/${pair_id}/${platform}/segmentation/` (symlink mode).

The durable latest zarr written by this stage lives at
`${outdir}/${pair_id}/${platform}/latest/latest_spatialdata.zarr`. The
`segment_out/proseg_base_latest.zarr` in the work dir is a staged symlink to
that path.

## Walkthrough

1. **Load and prepare images.** For MERSCOPE, image z-planes and channels are
   stacked and projected. For Xenium, morphology focus is used directly.
   Image I/O lives in
   [io/image_source.py](../../src/merxen/io/image_source.py).
2. **Cellpose tiling.** `run_tiled_cellpose` picks a tile size from
   `TilingConfig.tile_size_candidates` (`6144 → 1024`) small enough for
   available RAM, iterates over overlapping tiles, runs Cellpose on each,
   filters each tile's masks by regionprops, and stitches whole objects whose
   centroids fall inside each tile core. Duplicate objects from neighboring
   halos are skipped by overlap thresholds, while accepted objects are pasted
   into a global label space. The result is a `(H, W)` uint32 array saved as
   `cellpose_masks_tiled.npy`.
3. **Transform to microns.** `build_cellpose_affine_to_microns` composes the
   platform transform with any rescale factor. This gives `(x_transform,
   y_transform)` 1D affine components used when writing the ProSeg CSV and
   seeding cell IDs.
4. **Final Cellpose area filter.** The saved mask is memory-mapped, label
   areas are converted to square microns, and masks outside
   `cellpose_final_min_area_um2` / `cellpose_final_max_area_um2` are removed in
   row chunks. The cleaned `cellpose_masks_tiled.npy` is the only mask used by
   the transcript seeding and ProSeg steps.
5. **Seed transcripts.** `write_proseg_csv_from_points` streams the
   transcripts points object in chunks of
   `memory.transcript_chunk_rows`, looks each transcript's pixel location
   up in the mask, and writes a row with `x_micron`, `y_micron`, `z_micron`,
   `feature_name`, `cell_id` (0 if outside any cell). Xenium transcripts
   below `dataset.min_qv` are dropped.
6. **Process handoff.** Nextflow stages the mask, transcript CSV, and affine
   metadata from the GPU process into the CPU process work directory.
7. **ProSeg.** The workflow resolves ProSeg via `ENSURE_PROSEG`; if it is not
   found in the configured search paths, the bootstrap step installs it with
   Cargo. `run_proseg_refinement` then spawns the resolved external binary.
   ProSeg
   uses the Cellpose-seeded `cell_id` column as a prior and performs MCMC
   sampling over the transcript field, letting cell boundaries move to
   better match transcript density.
8. **To "latest" zarr.** `convert_to_latest_zarr` rewrites the raw ProSeg
   output so it can be read with the current SpatialData version, then stages
   that durable zarr back into the work dir for Nextflow.

## Outputs

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `latest/latest_spatialdata.zarr` | Durable refined SpatialData zarr. This is the object enrichment mutates in place. |
| `segmentation/proseg_base_latest.zarr` | Staged symlink to the durable latest zarr. |
| `cellpose_masks_tiled.npy` | Cleaned global-pixel Cellpose labels, consumed by ProSeg and enrichment. |
| `cellpose_stitching_stats.json` | Tile stitching diagnostics: accepted labels, duplicates, conflicts, edge-touching labels, and thresholds. |
| `transcripts_for_proseg.csv` | The transcript CSV fed into ProSeg. Retained for debugging. |
| `cellpose_transforms.json` | Pixel-to-micron affine terms used by the ProSeg process. |

`proseg_base_raw.zarr` is treated as a transient intermediate and removed
after the latest-format zarr is written successfully.

## Memory guardrails

The stage functions free memory aggressively:

- `force_release()` is called after the transcript CSV write and after the
  full run, triggering `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`.
- `enforce_memory_limit` in
  [memory.py:47](../../src/merxen/memory.py#L47) is called while streaming
  transcripts and raises when `MemoryConfig.max_system_ram_gb` is exceeded.
- Tile size auto-selection falls back down `tile_size_candidates` until
  memory fits.

## Common failures

- **ProSeg bootstrap failed** — no executable was found in
  `proseg_search_paths`, `cargo install proseg` failed, or the configured
  `proseg_install_path` needs `sudo` and permission was denied.
- **All transcripts filtered out** — the QV filter (`xenium_min_qv`) is too
  strict, or the points columns didn't resolve. `resolve_col` tries
  `x`, `global_x`, `x_location` and `gene`, `feature_name`, `target`.
- **Cellpose GPU OOM** — lower `cellpose_bsize` or drop the largest entry
  from `tile_size_candidates`. Or pass `--cellpose_gpu false` to force CPU.
- **Zarr half-written on crash** — delete the durable
  `latest/latest_spatialdata.zarr` and rerun with `-resume`.
